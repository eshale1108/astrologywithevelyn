        <h2>Welcome to Astrology with Evelyn</h2>
        <div class="intro-text">
            <p>Hello, I’m Evelyn Hale. I’m excited to share my journey and the transformative work I offer as an astrologer.</p>
            <p>Astrology is a powerful tool for understanding ourselves and the world around us. It allows us to weave a rich tapestry of personal insight through birth charts, offering guidance and hope for both the present and future. Since the age of 15, I have immersed myself in astrology, and my recent training through Rising Woman's Mystic Astrology Apprenticeship program has deepened my commitment to helping others. My focus is on supporting survivors of childhood trauma, helping them reconnect with their inner wisdom and break free from limiting beliefs.</p>
            <p>My journey to healing began in childhood, navigating trauma and abuse, and led me to holistic practices that reversed self-sabotage and limiting beliefs. I believe that astrology can end cycles of generational trauma and contribute to collective healing. If my story resonates with you, I invite you to explore astrology as a tool for your personal growth and healing.</p>
